      Hi love, we've been on and off ever since and I guess those past few weeks challenged me whether kakayanin ba kita or hinde, and maybe I was having a hard time handling the challenge because I have come to an conclusion na lately I became more obsessed sayo. I want you all to myself, and I hate na may makahati ako sayo. I dont want my obsession be the reason why we fell apart kaya gusto ko na ayusin ung satin kasi I cant imagine marrying anyone else. Please accept my apology for how I handled you and your ugali. I love you sofiya, best bf mo nako ulit? asawa na ulit?
